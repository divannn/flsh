/*The Background class controls the scrolling background. There are four unique background drawings inside a Background movie clip. The background will always scroll by at frame rate until it reaches the end of a drawingat which point the background movie clip will advance to the next frame.*/package{	import flash.display.*	import flash.events.*	import flash.ui.*		public class Background extends MovieClip	{		//This constructor gets called when the background is loaded to the stage		public function Background()		{			//add an ENTER_FRAME event so we can update its position at frame rate			addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, enterFrame);			//stop the background movie clip on frame one			stop();		}				//we want this logic to happen at frame rate		public function enterFrame(e:Event)		{			//subtract one from the x position of the background			x-=1;						//if we have scrolled all the way to the end of the background image			if(x < -2110)			{				//and if we have are not already on the final background				if(currentFrame < 4)				{					//go to the next frame of the background and rest its x position to zero					x=0;					nextFrame();				}				else				{					//if we have reached the last background, kill the ENTER_FRAME event and add the final Boss to the stage					removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, enterFrame);					//this creates an instance of the final Boss class					var b = new Boss();					//this displays the graphic					Game.main.spriteClip.addChild(b);				}			}		}				//this is a handy way to stop the background from scrolling		public function disable()		{			removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, enterFrame);		}				//this will set the background back to frame one, reset it's position, and start it scrolling with the ENTER_FRAME event		public function reset()		{			addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, enterFrame);			gotoAndStop(1);			x=0;		}	}}
