Beginners:
The Shootorials are a set of Flash game programming tutorials designed to walk a beginner through the process 
of making a simple side scrolling shooter game. The source code for each Shootorial is available via a download
link on the web page containing the Shootorial. Aspiring game developers interested in learning the basics can
use that source code as a spring board for making Flash games using ActionScript 2.0. 

Shoot: The Shootorial Game is an example of the type of game you can build after completing the Shootorials. 

Advanced Flash Game Developers:

interested in making the switch from ActionScript 2.0 to ActionScript 3.0 are welcome to download the source
code for Shoot: The Shootorial Game, to see how a simple side scrolling shooter can be built from the ground up
using ActionScript 3.0. All of the code is commented line by line and demonstrates many of the techniques used
