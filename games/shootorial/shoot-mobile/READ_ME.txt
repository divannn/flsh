This archive contains a slightly modified version of Shoot! to optimize it for play on mobile devices. 
The input method has been changed from keyboard to mouse/touch events, and the game will pause when it 
detects that it is not in full-screen mode. The assets have also been compressed at a higher level to 
reduce the size of the SWF.
