/*The Background class controls the scrolling background. There are four unique background drawings inside a Background movie clip. The background will always scroll by at frame rate until it reaches the end of a drawingat which point the background movie clip will advance to the next frame.*/package{	import flash.display.*	import flash.events.*	import flash.ui.*		public class Background extends MovieClip	{	  private var boss:Boolean = false;	  		//This constructor gets called when the background is loaded to the stage		public function Background()		{			reset();		}				//we want this logic to happen at frame rate		public function enterFrame(e:Event)		{			//subtract one from the x position of the background			x-=1;						//if we have scrolled all the way to the end of the background image			if(x < -2110)			{			  x=0;			  				//and if we have are not already on the final background				if(currentFrame < 4)				{					//go to the next frame of the background and rest its x position to zero					nextFrame();				}				else if(!boss)				{					//this displays the graphic				  boss = true;				  var b = new Boss();					Game.main.spriteClip.addChild(b);				}			}		}				//this is a handy way to stop the background from scrolling		public function disable()		{			FrameTimer.remove(this);		}				//this will set the background back to frame one, reset it's position, and start it scrolling with the ENTER_FRAME event		public function reset()		{			FrameTimer.add(this);			gotoAndStop(1);			x=0;			boss=false;		}	}}
